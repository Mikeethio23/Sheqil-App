# Sheqil-App
Sheqil is a driver assistant app designed to help drivers filter through, and auto accept/reject drive requests from various ride hailing companies based on preset parameters they set themselves. I come from a developing country so talent is rare and very expensive to hire, considering that I am still a student/ start up founder who is passionate about solving problems. I would appreciate any volunteers who can help me bring my ideas to life. I will offer compensation once the app is brought to life and we monetize. Please do help a start up founder. 

my email is michaelbgetaneh@gmail.com if you would like to discuss more
